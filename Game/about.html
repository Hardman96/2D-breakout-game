      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p> Through the HTML canvas element I expanded on an already written game. The game is written in JavaScript and has no server side features.
           The game is a simplified & modified 2D breakout game. The game is unfinished and has no server side features, features such as persistant storage
           or user inputs to allow custom settings to be programmed into the game. The game uses a car as opposed to a paddle to catch the ball. The car
           is an interactive object which the user will control with the left or right arrows on the keyboard. The ball will increase in speed per block hit,
           unless the ball hits the canvas border, it will continue to get faster putting an extra emphasis on hand-eye coordination, this is ontop of the focus
           already needed as per the nature of the game. The speed of the ball will be reset once the border has been hit. The game includes a background which was
           created by myself and was inspired (in terms of theme) by myself. The background contains dynamic objects such as moving clouds for extra flare.

      <h2>A full acount of external resources which was used in the creation of this game.</h2>
      <p> The tutorial used in the creation of this game is 'MDN's 2D breakout game using pure JavaScript'. I used page 1-7 of this tutorial. I used this tutorial as
          a foundation (i.e. game idea), the code needed to handle the problems in the game were also taken from the tutorial, although I expanded on them. I have not
          used any other tutorials for the creation of this game. All code in this assignment is either taken from blackboard, written by me or the specified tutorial +
          personal modifications. I used the house function provided by blackboard, although I changed it.
