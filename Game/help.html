      <h4> How to start & play the the game? </h4>
      <p> <em>Loading</em> the game is very simple, clicking/loading the webpage titled 'Game' will cause the game to load allowing the game to be played. </p>
      <p> <em>Playing</em> the game is also simple. The left and right arrows (via keyboard) allows the user to influence the cars direction. Left arrow = move left,
              right arrow = move right. The goal of the game is to destroy all blocks, but to also last as long as possible. The blocks are arranged on screen
              in a way so collisions are likely, but in tight and confined spaces. The ball will increase in speed per hit until the border is hit, at which point the
              speed will be reset back to normal. You must watch the ball carefully and be ready to catch it, failure to do so will trigger the end game notification.
